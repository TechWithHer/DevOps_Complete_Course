ðŸ”¹ EC2 Instance Networking

ping â†’ check connectivity between instances or to the internet.

curl / wget â†’ test HTTP(S) endpoints from EC2.

traceroute / mtr â†’ see path from EC2 to destination (helps with route table issues).

nc (netcat) â†’ test if specific ports are reachable (e.g., DB port, app port).

ss / netstat â†’ list active connections, listening ports.

ip addr / ip route â†’ check private/public IPs and routing within the instance.

arp / ip neigh â†’ local neighbor resolution (rare but can help for ENI debugging).

ðŸ”¹ VPC / Networking Debugging

AWS CLI commands:

aws ec2 describe-vpcs â†’ list VPCs

aws ec2 describe-subnets â†’ list subnets & CIDRs

aws ec2 describe-route-tables â†’ check routing rules

aws ec2 describe-security-groups â†’ view security group rules

aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces â†’ ENI details, private IPs, MACs

aws ec2 describe-instances â†’ verify IP assignment and network status

VPC Flow Logs â†’ check allowed/blocked traffic inside your VPC.

ðŸ”¹ DNS & Endpoint Testing

dig / nslookup â†’ test Route53 records.

curl -v â†’ test connectivity to API Gateway, ELB, or other endpoints.

ping â†’ test connectivity (if ICMP allowed by SG/NACL).

ðŸ”¹ Security & Firewall

iptables -L â†’ instance-level firewall rules (rare in AWS, usually SG/NACL handles it).

nmap â†’ scan instance ports to verify open/closed ports (if allowed by SG).

ðŸ”¹ Load Balancers & Public Services

curl / wget â†’ test ELB endpoints.

dig â†’ verify DNS for ALB/CNAME records.

ðŸ”¹ Cloud-Native Debugging Tools

aws cloudwatch get-metric-data â†’ monitor network traffic metrics.

aws logs tail <log-group> â†’ check VPC flow logs or app logs in real-time.

aws ec2 get-console-output â†’ for boot/network errors on instance launch.
