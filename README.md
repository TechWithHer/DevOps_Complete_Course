# 🚀 My 100-Days DevOps Journey

I’ve set myself on a **100-days journey** to master and share DevOps in a structured, hands-on way.

**My approach:**

1. **Checklist of Essentials** – covering only what every DevOps engineer *must know*.  
2. **Hands-on Projects** – learning by building real-world use cases.  
3. **Sharing Everywhere** – so others can follow and learn with me.
