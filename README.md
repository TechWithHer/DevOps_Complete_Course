Hey Everyone, Glad you stopped by. 

# 🚀 My 100-Days DevOps Journey

I’ve set myself on a **100-days journey** to master and share DevOps in a structured, hands-on way.

**My approach:**

1. **Checklist of Essentials** – covering only what every DevOps engineer *must know*.  
2. **Hands-on Projects** – learning by building real-world use cases.  
3. **Sharing Everywhere** – so others can follow and learn with me.

## 📌 Roadmap

Here’s how I’m breaking it down over 100 days:

### Phase 1 – Foundations
- Networking for DevOps  
- Linux for DevOps  
- Git & GitHub  

### Phase 2 – Core Tools
- Docker  
- Jenkins & CI/CD  
- Kubernetes  

### Phase 3 – Automation & Cloud
- Ansible  
- Monitoring in DevOps  
- Terraform  
- AWS & Cloud Basics  

👉 After this, I’ll move into **real-world projects**, integrating all tools and practices together.
